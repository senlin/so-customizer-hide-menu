Hides the Navigation Menu from the Customizer so as not to confuse anyone.

== Description ==

Whilst many people have opposed the decision, the navigation menu interface was forced into the Customizer.

As there are many people who don't have to time to explain this to all existing clients, this plugin simply hides the menu panel/section from the Customizer.

We support this plugin exclusively through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-customizer-hide-menu/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.
